  <p>The Code Activism Manifesto</p>
  <h3>Kindness</h3>
  <p>Be kind and don't be an arsehole. Relax and don't take yourself too seriously. This is not about you and there's no room for ego in activism.</p>
  <quote>"Bitch, be humble. Sit down" (Kendric Lamar)</quote>
  <h3>Open Source</h3>
  <p>Contribute to open source if you can. So much of the software we use today is thanks to the hard work of individuals who volunteer their time.</p>
  <p>Sharing is caring, and many crucial open source projects are starving for contributors.</p>
  <p>The work is sometimes thankless, but this is the only way we can keep critical projects visible and free from absolute commercial control.</p>
  <h3>Mentoring</h3>
  <p>Mentor and coach inexperienced engineers because software is a craft, and not an exact science.</p>
  <p>We acquire knowledge through experience, friction, time and exposure. Much of what we know cannot be taught in school or university.</p>
  <p>Give back, and teach these so that you can help others grow.</p>
  <h3>Inclusiveness</h3>
  <p>Gates are open, so come on in. There are no entry barriers and all are welcome, regardless of age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation.</p>
  <h3>Conferences</h3>
  <p>Participate in public forums to teach, learn and share.</p>
  <p>Conferences and meetups are excellent venues to meet and befriend your peers. These professional connections are invaluable in both activism and career.</p>
